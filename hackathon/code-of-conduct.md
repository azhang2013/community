# Code of Conduct

We want everyone participating in _any_ event that we host to feel safe and welcome. For that reason, we expect ALL participants, including competitors, hackers, sponsors, staff, judges and partners to agree with our code of conduct. We will enforce this throughout the event.

We want everyone to have a good time during our events. We take creating the right environment for this very seriously.

**NEAR is dedicated to making this hackathon (and any event we host) a harassment free zone.**

Examples of harassment include offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, use of sexualised images, activities, or other material. 

Staff should not create or promote harassing content at our events.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment in the material they provide to events.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact immediately a member of the conference team at [harassment@nearprotocol.com](mailto:harassment@nearprotocol.com). 

We will be happy to assist with any concerns you might have.
